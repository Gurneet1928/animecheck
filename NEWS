v1 (13.06.13):
This script has now been around long enough and has done its core job adequately enough to reach version 1 finally! Only a minor functionality update from the user perspective:

-n/--no-summary added to prevent outputting a hashing task summary (https://github.com/OmegaPhil/animecheck/issues/21)
ed2k link mode now outputs a hashing task summary - all modes should now do so (https://github.com/OmegaPhil/animecheck/issues/21)

v0.11 (08.05.13):
Actually ignore symlinks in MD5 hashing and ed2k link generation modes (https://github.com/OmegaPhil/animecheck/issues/14)
When ran under Windows, ANSI escape codes are now used - cleanup courtesy of wiiaboo
Possibility of fixing a rare bug where the script is told more data has been hashed from a file than it was expecting (https://github.com/OmegaPhil/animecheck/issues/18)

v0.10 (20.01.13):
CRITICAL UPDATE - see below.

Fixed error handler in md5_create_mode and sfv_create_mode referencing checksumFileOutput before it was assigned (https://github.com/OmegaPhil/animecheck/issues/13)
os.walk was ignoring errors when generating a list of files to hash!! This incompetence has been fixed - user is warned when errors happen whilst listing directories (https://github.com/OmegaPhil/animecheck/issues/13)
More unicode bullshit 1! Script now copes with invalid encoding in paths (e.g. from an extracted Japanese zip) and alerts the user to the fact the files won't be hashed (https://github.com/OmegaPhil/animecheck/issues/13)
More unicode bullshit 2! Python 2 under Debian uses the invalid default encoding of ASCII even in a UTF-8 locale - this is what caused the original 'program arguments are ASCII' error. I discovered this after Python failed to write to a stderr redirected file as it was writing in ASCII when everything else was unicode (...) (https://github.com/OmegaPhil/animecheck/issues/16)
Hash failures are now outputted to stderr rather than stdout (this should be the case for all error and warning messages now) (https://github.com/OmegaPhil/animecheck/issues/17)
DEFAULT BEHAVIOUR CHANGE: Symlinks and hardlinks are now ignored by default - '-l/--links' is now available to pay attention to them again (https://github.com/OmegaPhil/animecheck/issues/14)

The changes here are a result of hashing >400,000 files of >700GB to create an sfv file to prove a drive copy operation worked) - the script should now be more usable with large hashing jobs (redirect stderr to file to avoid hash success spam).   

Because of this further unicode incompetence and os.walk's retarded ignoring of errors by default, I can't consider this script to have reached v1 yet - there's no reason to expect that no further bullshit will happen at this stage.

v0.9 (17.11.12):
Fix script when ran under Python 3 - unicode arguments change from v0.6 broke in Python 3 (https://github.com/OmegaPhil/animecheck/issues/4 - credit wiiaboo)
Cleaner reporting of missing files in checksum read modes (https://github.com/OmegaPhil/animecheck/issues/12)

v0.8 (20.10.12):
Fix for md5 checksum file processing - deal with files that weren't read in binary mode (https://github.com/OmegaPhil/animecheck/issues/11 - credit Kovensky on #JEEB)

v0.7 (08.09.12):
Addition of tracebacks to unknown errors
More unicode fail from python... fix to actually allow unicode filenames in checksum files (https://github.com/OmegaPhil/animecheck/issues/9)

v0.6 (29.07.12):
Fix to make errors during hashing in checksum file creation modes much more obvious and recorded (https://github.com/OmegaPhil/animecheck/issues/6)
Hashing task stats now reported at the end of checksum file creation modes too
Fix python treating file paths passed to the program as ASCII - prevented hashing of files with paths containing unicode characters outside of the ASCII subset (https://github.com/OmegaPhil/animecheck/issues/4)
Output help when user passes no arguments
Removed exceptions module import - doesn't exist in Python 3 (https://github.com/OmegaPhil/animecheck/issues/5)

v0.5 (17.07.12):
wiiaboo fixes to properly support Windows Command Prompt, and fixes for running the script under Python v3 - thanks :) (https://github.com/OmegaPhil/animecheck/pull/3)

v0.4 (06.04.12):
Fix to allow directories to be passed in (https://github.com/OmegaPhil/animecheck/issues/2)
Add md5_hash_mode to MD5 hash passed files (https://github.com/OmegaPhil/animecheck/issues/1)

v0.3 (26.02.12):
Ability to add CRC32 hashes to the filenames of files without them.
checksum read mode (sfv and md5).
md5 create mode.
sfv create mode.
eD2k link mode.
